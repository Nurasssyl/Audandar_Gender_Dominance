# Gender Dominance in the districts of Kazakhstan

![](Audandar_Gender_Dominance.jpeg)

I have compiled a map of sexual dominance in the regions of Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: devtools, geokz, dpls, sf, tmap.

💓 Red - more men in the area
💙 Blue - more women in the area
👤 gray is a newly created area without data

I noticed that 

There are more women in megacities
There are more men in Mangystau region in all its districts
The male population dominates 129 districts
In 95 districts, the female population dominates

⚖️ The overall ratio of men to women: 0.954 (which means that for every 100 women there are about 95 men)

In Zhetysai district, there are 5,072 more men than women, while in Karaganda city there are 36,002 more women than men, which represents the largest positive and negative differences, respectively
